	MaxOutputLength         = 30000
	bashDescriptionTemplate = `Executes a given bash command in a persistent shell session with optional timeout, ensuring proper handling and security measures.

Before executing the command, please follow these steps:

1. Directory Verification:
 - If the command will create new directories or files, first use the LS tool to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location
 - For example, before running "mkdir foo/bar", first use LS to check that "foo" exists and is the intended parent directory

2. Security Check:
 - For security and to limit the threat of a prompt injection attack, some commands are limited or banned. If you use a disallowed command, you will receive an error message explaining the restriction. Explain the error to the User.
 - Verify that the command is not one of the banned commands: %s.

3. Command Execution:
 - After ensuring proper quoting, execute the command.
 - Capture the output of the command.

4. Output Processing:
 - If the output exceeds %d characters, output will be truncated before being returned to you.
 - Prepare the output for display to the user.

5. Return Result:
 - Provide the processed output of the command.
 - If any errors occurred during execution, include those in the output.

Usage notes:
- The command argument is required.
- You can specify an optional timeout in milliseconds (up to 600000ms / 10 minutes). If not specified, commands will timeout after 30 minutes.
- VERY IMPORTANT: You MUST avoid using search commands like 'find' and 'grep'. Instead use Grep, Glob, or Agent tools to search. You MUST avoid read tools like 'cat', 'head', 'tail', and 'ls', and use FileRead and LS tools to read files.
- When issuing multiple commands, use the ';' or '&&' operator to separate them. DO NOT use newlines (newlines are ok in quoted strings).
- IMPORTANT: All commands share the same shell session. Shell state (environment variables, virtual environments, current directory, etc.) persist between commands. For example, if you set an environment variable as part of a command, the environment variable will persist for subsequent commands.
- Try to maintain your current working directory throughout the session by using absolute paths and avoiding usage of 'cd'. You may use 'cd' if the User explicitly requests it.

# Committing changes with git

When the user asks you to create a new git commit, follow these steps carefully:

1. Start with a single message that contains exactly three tool_use blocks that do the following (it is VERY IMPORTANT that you send these tool_use blocks in a single message, otherwise it will feel slow to the user!):
 - Run a git status command to see all untracked files.
 - Run a git diff command to see both staged and unstaged changes that will be committed.
 - Run a git log command to see recent commit messages, so that you can follow this repository's commit message style.

2. Use the git context at the start of this conversation to determine which files are relevant to your commit. Add relevant untracked files to the staging area. Do not commit files that were already modified at the start of this conversation, if they are not relevant to your commit.

3. Analyze all staged changes (both previously staged and newly added) and draft a commit message. Wrap your analysis process in <commit_analysis> tags:

<commit_analysis>
- List the files that have been changed or added
- Summarize the nature of the changes (eg. new feature, enhancement to an existing feature, bug fix, refactoring, test, docs, etc.)
- Brainstorm the purpose or motivation behind these changes
- Do not use tools to explore code, beyond what is available in the git context
- Assess the impact of these changes on the overall project
- Check for any sensitive information that shouldn't be committed
- Draft a concise (1-2 sentences) commit message that focuses on the "why" rather than the "what"
- Ensure your language is clear, concise, and to the point
- Ensure the message accurately reflects the changes and their purpose (i.e. "add" means a wholly new feature, "update" means an enhancement to an existing feature, "fix" means a bug fix, etc.)
- Ensure the message is not generic (avoid words like "Update" or "Fix" without context)
- Review the draft message to ensure it accurately reflects the changes and their purpose
</commit_analysis>

4. Create the commit with a message ending with:
Generated with ferryer
Co-Authored-By: ferryer <noreply@ferryer.ai>

- In order to ensure good formatting, ALWAYS pass the commit message via a HEREDOC, a la this example:
<example>
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
 Commit message here.

 Generated with ferryer
 Co-Authored-By: ferryer <noreply@ferryer.ai>
 EOF
 )"
</example>

5. If the commit fails due to pre-commit hook changes, retry the commit ONCE to include these automated changes. If it fails again, it usually means a pre-commit hook is preventing the commit. If the commit succeeds but you notice that files were modified by the pre-commit hook, you MUST amend your commit to include them.

6. Finally, run git status to make sure the commit succeeded.

Important notes:
- When possible, combine the "git add" and "git commit" commands into a single "git commit -am" command, to speed things up
- However, be careful not to stage files (e.g. with 'git add .') for commits that aren't part of the change, they may have untracked files they want to keep around, but not commit.
- NEVER update the git config
- DO NOT push to the remote repository
- IMPORTANT: Never use git commands with the -i flag (like git rebase -i or git add -i) since they require interactive input which is not supported.
- If there are no changes to commit (i.e., no untracked files and no modifications), do not create an empty commit
- Ensure your commit message is meaningful and concise. It should explain the purpose of the changes, not just describe them.
- Return an empty response - the user will see the git output directly

# Creating pull requests
Use the gh command via the Bash tool for ALL GitHub-related tasks including working with issues, pull requests, checks, and releases. If given a Github URL use the gh command to get the information needed.

IMPORTANT: When the user asks you to create a pull request, follow these steps carefully:

1. Understand the current state of the branch. Remember to send a single message that contains multiple tool_use blocks (it is VERY IMPORTANT that you do this in a single message, otherwise it will feel slow to the user!):
 - Run a git status command to see all untracked files.
 - Run a git diff command to see both staged and unstaged changes that will be committed.
 - Check if the current branch tracks a remote branch and is up to date with the remote, so you know if you need to push to the remote
 - Run a git log command and 'git diff main...HEAD' to understand the full commit history for the current branch (from the time it diverged from the 'main' branch.)

2. Create new branch if needed

3. Commit changes if needed

4. Push to remote with -u flag if needed

5. Analyze all changes that will be included in the pull request, making sure to look at all relevant commits (not just the latest commit, but all commits that will be included in the pull request!), and draft a pull request summary. Wrap your analysis process in <pr_analysis> tags:

<pr_analysis>
- List the commits since diverging from the main branch
- Summarize the nature of the changes (eg. new feature, enhancement to an existing feature, bug fix, refactoring, test, docs, etc.)
- Brainstorm the purpose or motivation behind these changes
- Assess the impact of these changes on the overall project
- Do not use tools to explore code, beyond what is available in the git context
- Check for any sensitive information that shouldn't be committed
- Draft a concise (1-2 bullet points) pull request summary that focuses on the "why" rather than the "what"
- Ensure the summary accurately reflects all changes since diverging from the main branch
- Ensure your language is clear, concise, and to the point
- Ensure the summary accurately reflects the changes and their purpose (ie. "add" means a wholly new feature, "update" means an enhancement to an existing feature, "fix" means a bug fix, etc.)
- Ensure the summary is not generic (avoid words like "Update" or "Fix" without context)
- Review the draft summary to ensure it accurately reflects the changes and their purpose
</pr_analysis>

6. Create PR using gh pr create with the format below. Use a HEREDOC to pass the body to ensure correct formatting.
<example>
gh pr create --title "the pr title" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
<1-3 bullet points>

## Test plan
[Checklist of TODOs for testing the pull request...]

Generated with ferryer
EOF
)"
</example>

Important:
- Return an empty response - the user will see the gh output directly
- Never update git config`

const (
	EditToolName    = "edit"
	editDescription = `Edits files by replacing text, creating new files, or deleting content. For moving or renaming files, use the Bash tool with the 'mv' command instead. For larger file edits, use the FileWrite tool to overwrite files.

Before using this tool:

1. Use the FileRead tool to understand the file's contents and context

2. Verify the directory path is correct (only applicable when creating new files):
   - Use the LS tool to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location

To make a file edit, provide the following:
1. file_path: The absolute path to the file to modify (must be absolute, not relative)
2. old_string: The text to replace (must be unique within the file, and must match the file contents exactly, including all whitespace and indentation)
3. new_string: The edited text to replace the old_string

Special cases:
- To create a new file: provide file_path and new_string, leave old_string empty
- To delete content: provide file_path and old_string, leave new_string empty

The tool will replace ONE occurrence of old_string with new_string in the specified file.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR USING THIS TOOL:

1. UNIQUENESS: The old_string MUST uniquely identify the specific instance you want to change. This means:
   - Include AT LEAST 3-5 lines of context BEFORE the change point
   - Include AT LEAST 3-5 lines of context AFTER the change point
   - Include all whitespace, indentation, and surrounding code exactly as it appears in the file

2. SINGLE INSTANCE: This tool can only change ONE instance at a time. If you need to change multiple instances:
   - Make separate calls to this tool for each instance
   - Each call must uniquely identify its specific instance using extensive context

3. VERIFICATION: Before using this tool:
   - Check how many instances of the target text exist in the file
   - If multiple instances exist, gather enough context to uniquely identify each one
   - Plan separate tool calls for each instance

WARNING: If you do not follow these requirements:
   - The tool will fail if old_string matches multiple locations
   - The tool will fail if old_string doesn't match exactly (including whitespace)
   - You may change the wrong instance if you don't include enough context

When making edits:
   - Ensure the edit results in idiomatic, correct code
   - Do not leave the code in a broken state
   - Always use absolute file paths (starting with /)

Remember: when making multiple file edits in a row to the same file, you should prefer to send all edits in a single message with multiple calls to this tool, rather than multiple messages with a single call each.`

TIPS:
- Use text format for plain text content or simple API responses
- Use markdown format for content that should be rendered with formatting
- Use html format when you need the raw HTML structure
- Set appropriate timeouts for potentially slow websites`
)

const (
	GlobToolName    = "glob"
	globDescription = `Fast file pattern matching tool that finds files by name and pattern, returning matching paths sorted by modification time (newest first).

WHEN TO USE THIS TOOL:
- Use when you need to find files by name patterns or extensions
- Great for finding specific file types across a directory structure
- Useful for discovering files that match certain naming conventions

HOW TO USE:
- Provide a glob pattern to match against file paths
- Optionally specify a starting directory (defaults to current working directory)
- Results are sorted with most recently modified files first

GLOB PATTERN SYNTAX:
- '*' matches any sequence of non-separator characters
- '**' matches any sequence of characters, including separators
- '?' matches any single non-separator character
- '[...]' matches any character in the brackets
- '[!...]' matches any character not in the brackets

COMMON PATTERN EXAMPLES:
- '*.js' - Find all JavaScript files in the current directory
- '**/*.js' - Find all JavaScript files in any subdirectory
- 'src/**/*.{ts,tsx}' - Find all TypeScript files in the src directory
- '*.{html,css,js}' - Find all HTML, CSS, and JS files

LIMITATIONS:
- Results are limited to 100 files (newest first)
- Does not search file contents (use Grep tool for that)
- Hidden files (starting with '.') are skipped

TIPS:
- For the most useful results, combine with the Grep tool: first find files with Glob, then search their contents with Grep
- When doing iterative exploration that may require multiple rounds of searching, consider using the Agent tool instead
- Always check if results are truncated and refine your search pattern if needed`
)

const (
	GrepToolName    = "grep"
	grepDescription = `Fast content search tool that finds files containing specific text or patterns, returning matching file paths sorted by modification time (newest first).

WHEN TO USE THIS TOOL:
- Use when you need to find files containing specific text or patterns
- Great for searching code bases for function names, variable declarations, or error messages
- Useful for finding all files that use a particular API or pattern

HOW TO USE:
- Provide a regex pattern to search for within file contents
- Set literal_text=true if you want to search for the exact text with special characters (recommended for non-regex users)
- Optionally specify a starting directory (defaults to current working directory)
- Optionally provide an include pattern to filter which files to search
- Results are sorted with most recently modified files first

REGEX PATTERN SYNTAX (when literal_text=false):
- Supports standard regular expression syntax
- 'function' searches for the literal text "function"
- 'log\..*Error' finds text starting with "log." and ending with "Error"
- 'import\s+.*\s+from' finds import statements in JavaScript/TypeScript

COMMON INCLUDE PATTERN EXAMPLES:
- '*.js' - Only search JavaScript files
- '*.{ts,tsx}' - Only search TypeScript files
- '*.go' - Only search Go files

LIMITATIONS:
- Results are limited to 100 files (newest first)
- Performance depends on the number of files being searched
- Very large binary files may be skipped
- Hidden files (starting with '.') are skipped

TIPS:
- For faster, more targeted searches, first use Glob to find relevant files, then use Grep
- When doing iterative exploration that may require multiple rounds of searching, consider using the Agent tool instead
- Always check if results are truncated and refine your search pattern if needed
- Use literal_text=true when searching for exact text containing special characters like dots, parentheses, etc.`

const (
	LSToolName    = "ls"
	MaxLSFiles    = 1000
	lsDescription = `Directory listing tool that shows files and subdirectories in a tree structure, helping you explore and understand the project organization.

WHEN TO USE THIS TOOL:
- Use when you need to explore the structure of a directory
- Helpful for understanding the organization of a project
- Good first step when getting familiar with a new codebase

HOW TO USE:
- Provide a path to list (defaults to current working directory)
- Optionally specify glob patterns to ignore
- Results are displayed in a tree structure

FEATURES:
- Displays a hierarchical view of files and directories
- Automatically skips hidden files/directories (starting with '.')
- Skips common system directories like __pycache__
- Can filter out files matching specific patterns

LIMITATIONS:
- Results are limited to 1000 files
- Very large directories will be truncated
- Does not show file sizes or permissions
- Cannot recursively list all directories in a large project

TIPS:
- Use Glob tool for finding files by name patterns instead of browsing
- Use Grep tool for searching file contents
- Combine with other tools for more effective exploration`
)

const (
	PatchToolName    = "patch"
	patchDescription = `Applies a patch to multiple files in one operation. This tool is useful for making coordinated changes across multiple files.

The patch text must follow this format:
*** Begin Patch
*** Update File: /path/to/file
@@ Context line (unique within the file)
 Line to keep
-Line to remove
+Line to add
 Line to keep
*** Add File: /path/to/new/file
+Content of the new file
+More content
*** Delete File: /path/to/file/to/delete
*** End Patch

Before using this tool:
1. Use the FileRead tool to understand the files' contents and context
2. Verify all file paths are correct (use the LS tool)

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR USING THIS TOOL:

1. UNIQUENESS: Context lines MUST uniquely identify the specific sections you want to change
2. PRECISION: All whitespace, indentation, and surrounding code must match exactly
3. VALIDATION: Ensure edits result in idiomatic, correct code
4. PATHS: Always use absolute file paths (starting with /)

The tool will apply all changes in a single atomic operation.`
